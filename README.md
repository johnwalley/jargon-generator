### Local Development

If you want to edit the web app locally, you can run the server by typing:

    npm install
    node scripts/web-server.js

Now you can navigate to `http://localhost:8000` and see your jargon generator while you edit it.  __Note__: You have to restart the server when you make changes to
see them.
